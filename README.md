# To Run Code

Do `g++ -o output \*.cpp`

Then run `./output`

To make this more of an official assignment in the future, I think that there could be additional implementations.  
One of them is to involve requiring a method that takes in 2 keys and 2 values and then tries to simulate a valid or invalid transaction by using 1 function to increase the value of one user's bank account while decreasing the value of another user's bank account.  
Additionally, a requirement to make this more of an official assignment would be to use a testing framework for the desired language used to check the results of the program.  
For example, if you want to use a testing framework for C++, GoogleTest is frequently used.  
Another example is to use Pytest if you're checking Python code.  
This can make checking your code for expected outputs vs. unintended outputs easier to do, and so it's useful for graders and for students.
